# Sales Admin Challenge - Candidate: Matt Clevenger

## Instruction

### Background

Your company just acquired Acme Cult Hero Supplies. They have been using a CSV worksheet to track sales data, and you need to transform that into a web application to track revenue.

### Functional requirements

Using the web framework of your choice, deliver an application that meets the following requirements:

* Provides an interface for a user to upload the salesdata.csv file in this directory
* Parses and persists the information in the salesdata.csv file to a database
* Calculates and displays the total sales revenue to the user

Bonus points if you add authentication.

_Ideally you shouldn't spend more than 4-5 hours on your solution, but take as much time as you want._

### Delivery requirements

Please provide instructions for installing and running your application, including all dependencies. The simpler, the better, but we do use PostgreSQL if you want use that as a data store.

Think about things like:

* Testing
* How to store the data
* How would your solution differ if it had to scale?

Please submit your solution as a pull request, or package it up and send it to doug.ramsay@megaphone.fm.

### Credits

Yes, this challenge is copied from the LivingSocial code challenge. I helped put that together, so hopefully nobody will mind that much.
